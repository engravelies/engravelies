I HATE U ALL DISCOGRAPHY STORY GAMEPLAY BASIC MUSIC Ensemble Stars!! (あんさんぶるスターズ！！) is a multimedia project, originally released as a Japanese mobile idol training game on May 1st, 2015. As of March 16th, 2020, the app has two versions: Ensemble Stars!! Basic, the idol-training game, and Ensemble Stars!! Music, the rhythm game. Both versions of the game have different gameplay styles, but otherwise share the same story, characters, and cards. @DanTDM
